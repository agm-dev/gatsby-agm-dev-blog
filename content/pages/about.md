### Hi!

I'm Adri√°n Gonzalo, a full stack developer from Madrid, Spain. I'm focused on web and javascript technologies.

I've started this site because I want to document and share some of the side projects I'm always involved in. That should help me to remember the details of the project when I come back to it later, and might help someone else to learn about programming, javascript, and the different topics related.

If you want to contact me, use any of the social buttons :)
